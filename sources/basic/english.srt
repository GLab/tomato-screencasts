00:00:04,984 --> 00:00:08,710
Hello and welcome to the first ToMaTo screencast tutorial.

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,981
In this tutorial, you will learn how to create and operate your first topology.

3
00:00:12,981 --> 00:00:17,341
An instance of the ToMaTo testbed can be found at http://master.tomato-lab.org

4
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:21,521
I will now log in to my activated account.

5
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,388
After logging in, we see a list of all topologies of this user.

6
00:00:32,962 --> 00:00:34,542
In this case, this list is empty.

7
00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:37,504
We now have to create a new topology.

8
00:00:46,022 --> 00:00:49,663
We can now populate the empty topology by creating devices.

9
00:00:49,663 --> 00:00:55,182
For devices, we can select between KVM and OpenVZ devices.

10
00:00:55,182 --> 00:01:01,963
As a general rule, you should always select OpenVZ devices if you don't need the benefits that come with KVM.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,055
These newly created devices don't have any network connections yet.

12
00:01:15,218 --> 00:01:19,672
In this example, we will simply connect them to each other.

13
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:27,188
Now, we can prepare the topology.

14
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:32,249
This means that the testbed will create the virtual machines and their initial disk images.

15
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:56,679
The red 'stop' signs on the devices indicate that preparing has been finished.

16
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:59,720
We can now proceed to booting the devices.

17
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:15,000
When the devices have been started successfully, a green 'started' icon will appear on the devices.

18
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:22,813
In this tutorial, we will run a ping test to demonstrate the network functionality.

19
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:24,518
To do this, we first need the IP address of the left device.

20
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:29,281
Each network interface of a device appears as a grey dot.

21
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:34,635
You can get the IP address of a network interface from its configuration window.

22
00:02:43,803 --> 00:02:48,646
We can get VNC access to a device's console via its right-click menu.

23
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:01,917
Using 'ifconfig', you can show the device's network configuration.

24
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:07,137
In this case, there should be one ethernet interface, and one loopback interface.

25
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:18,131
Using the 'ping' command, we can run a ping test to the IP address we have discovered before.

26
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:33,486
After completing our tests, we should now clean up.

27
00:03:33,486 --> 00:03:36,286
First, we have to stop our devices.

28
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:42,306
This means that the virtual machines will be stopped, but they are not destroyed, and the disk images will be kept.

29
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:55,392
Since we don't need our devices anymore, we can destroy them.

30
00:03:55,392 --> 00:04:00,492
This means that the virtual machines and the disk images are deleted from the server.

31
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:10,635
We won't be using this topology anymore, so we can delete it.

32
00:04:18,184 --> 00:04:20,703
We have now completed the first screencast tutorial.

33
00:04:20,703 --> 00:04:25,443
In this tutorial, we have created a first topology consisting of two devices.

34
00:04:25,443 --> 00:04:28,904
We have started them, and then run a ping test between them.

35
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:37,167
Since you haven't seen all aspects of ToMaTo by now, I highly recommend you to work through the more specialized tutorials available at tomato-lab.org
